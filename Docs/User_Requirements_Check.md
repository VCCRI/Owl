#### Input 2D Images 

As a bioinformatician, I want to input an image directly into the application so that I can utilise this denoising application on all my datasets.   

##### Demonstration Commands

`python owl.py --file demo.png`  

The above command will implement owl with a user specified image   

#### Output 2D Images 

As a bioinformatician, I want to be able to output an image in multiple file formats, so that I can easily input them into other image analysis pipelines in future. 

##### Demonstration Commands 
`python owl.py --file demo.png --outfiletype jpeg`   

The above command will input a png file, and output a denoised jpeg file.
